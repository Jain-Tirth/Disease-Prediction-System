## 2. Abstract

This project presents a comprehensive disease prediction system that leverages machine learning algorithms to predict diseases based on patient symptoms. The system addresses the critical need for early disease diagnosis and healthcare accessibility by providing an intelligent, user-friendly web application. Using a dataset of 132 symptoms across 41 disease categories with 4,920 training samples and 42 test samples, we implemented and compared multiple ML algorithms including K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machines, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and XGBoost. The XGBoost classifier achieved the highest accuracy of [accuracy]% on the test dataset. The solution is deployed as a full-stack web application with a React-based frontend and FastAPI backend, enabling real-time disease prediction through an intuitive symptom selection interface. The system demonstrates practical applicability in telemedicine and preliminary diagnostic assistance.

## 3. Introduction

### 3.1 Problem Background and Relevance

Healthcare systems worldwide face challenges in providing timely and accurate disease diagnosis, particularly in regions with limited access to medical professionals. Early disease detection is crucial for effective treatment and improved patient outcomes. With the advancement of machine learning technologies, automated disease prediction systems can serve as valuable tools for preliminary diagnosis, triage, and healthcare decision support.

### 3.2 Real-World Motivation

1. **Healthcare Accessibility:** Many people lack immediate access to medical professionals, especially in rural or underserved areas
2. **Telemedicine Enhancement:** Remote healthcare services require intelligent systems to assist in preliminary diagnosis
3. **Early Warning Systems:** Rapid symptom assessment can help identify potential health emergencies
4. **Medical Education:** Training tools for medical students to understand symptom-disease relationships
5. **Healthcare Cost Reduction:** Reducing unnecessary hospital visits through preliminary self-assessment

### 3.3 Objectives of the Project

The primary objectives of this project are:

1. Develop a robust machine learning model capable of predicting diseases based on symptom patterns
2. Compare performance of multiple classification algorithms to identify the optimal model
3. Create a user-friendly web interface for symptom input and disease prediction
4. Deploy the solution as a full-stack application with RESTful API architecture

## 4. Literature Review / Related Work

### 4.1 Existing Approaches

**1. Symptom-Based Disease Prediction Using Decision Trees (Kumar et al., 2020)**
- Utilized decision tree algorithms for disease classification based on patient symptoms
- Achieved 85% accuracy on a limited disease dataset
- Gap: Limited to decision trees, no comparison with ensemble methods

**2. Deep Learning for Medical Diagnosis (Zhang et al., 2021)**
- Implemented neural networks for multi-class disease prediction
- Focused on image-based diagnosis combined with patient data
- Gap: Computationally expensive, requires extensive training data, lacks interpretability

**3. Expert Systems in Healthcare (Sharma & Kumar, 2019)**
- Rule-based expert systems for disease diagnosis
- High interpretability but limited adaptability
- Gap: Cannot learn from new data, requires manual rule updates

**4. Ensemble Methods for Disease Classification (Patel et al., 2022)**
- Compared Random Forest and Gradient Boosting for disease prediction
- Demonstrated superior performance of ensemble methods
- Gap: Limited symptom coverage, no web-based deployment

### 4.2 Research Gap

Existing systems either lack comprehensive symptom coverage, do not compare multiple ML algorithms systematically, or fail to provide accessible deployment through modern web interfaces. Our project addresses these gaps by:

1. Implementing and comparing 7 different ML algorithms
2. Using a comprehensive dataset with 132 symptoms across 41 diseases
3. Providing a production-ready full-stack web application
4. Utilizing modern frameworks (FastAPI, React) for scalability
5. Incorporating proper ML pipelines for reproducibility

### D. Key Code Snippets

#### D.1 Model Training and Saving
```python
from xgboost import XGBClassifier
from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline
from sklearn.compose import ColumnTransformer
import joblib
import json

# Train model
classifier = XGBClassifier()
classifier.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Create and save pipeline
feature_cols = X_train.columns.tolist()
preprocessor = ColumnTransformer([('pass', 'passthrough', feature_cols)])
pipeline = Pipeline([
    ('preprocessor', preprocessor),
    ('classifier', classifier)
])

# Save artifacts
joblib.dump(pipeline, 'backend/model.joblib')
joblib.dump(le, 'backend/label_encoder.joblib')
with open('backend/feature_names.json', 'w') as f:
    json.dump(feature_cols, f, indent=2)
```

#### D.2 FastAPI Backend Endpoint
```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException
from pydantic import BaseModel
import joblib

app = FastAPI()

@app.post("/predict")
def predict(req: PredictRequest):
    model = load_model()
    feature_names = load_feature_names()
    
    # Convert symptoms to vector
    if req.symptoms:
        x = [1 if fname in req.symptoms else 0 
             for fname in feature_names]
    else:
        x = req.input_vector
    
    # Predict
    pred = model.predict([x])
    
    # Decode label
    le = load_label_encoder()
    label = le.inverse_transform(pred)[0]
    
    return {"prediction": label, "raw_prediction": int(pred[0])}
```

#### D.3 React Frontend Component
```javascript
export default function SymptomForm() {
  const [features, setFeatures] = useState(null);
  const [checked, setChecked] = useState({});
  const [result, setResult] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    getFeatures().then(data => {
      setFeatures(data.features);
      const initial = {};
      data.features.forEach(f => initial[f] = false);
      setChecked(initial);
    });
  }, []);

  async function onSubmit(e) {
    e.preventDefault();
    const symptoms = Object.keys(checked).filter(k => checked[k]);
    const res = await predict({ symptoms });
    setResult(res);
  }

  return (
    <form onSubmit={onSubmit}>
      {features.map(f => (
        <label key={f}>
          <input type="checkbox" 
                 checked={!!checked[f]} 
                 onChange={() => toggle(f)} />
          {f}
        </label>
      ))}
      <button type="submit">Predict Disease</button>
      {result && <div>Prediction: {result.prediction}</div>}
    </form>
  );
}
```
